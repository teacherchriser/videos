At college graduation ceremonies,

00:09.467 --> 00:13.263
<i>students are often told</i>
<i>that the wait is finally over…</i>

00:13.346 --> 00:15.640
<i>You are moments away from graduating,</i>

00:15.724 --> 00:18.643
<i>moments away from beginning</i>
<i>your journey through life.</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:22.605
<i>[narrator] </i>…that they're now set up
for success, ready for anything.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.941
<i>You are capable</i>
<i>of greatness in your profession.</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:28.528
<i>You will be ready for work,</i>
<i>no matter what that work may be.</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:32.157
<i>You are prepared to play…</i>
<i>the game of life.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:34.325
<i>-The game of life.</i>
<i>-The game of life.</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:38.204
<i>[narrator] </i>In the actual <i>Game of Life,</i>
a classic board game,

00:38.288 --> 00:42.500
<i>the very first decision players make</i>
<i>is whether or not to go to college.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:47.005
<i>To pay for it, you have</i>
<i>to take out a loan, but that's fine.</i>

00:47.088 --> 00:49.257
<i>Your degree gets you a higher-paying job,</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:51.718
<i>you pay off your debts, no problem,</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:55.680
<i>and you buy a house, get married,</i>
<i>and fill your minivan with kids.</i>

00:56.347 --> 00:57.849
<i>That's how it works in the game,</i>

00:57.932 --> 01:00.435
<i>and for some people</i>
<i>in the real world, too.</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:04.898
<i>But for others, it doesn't go</i>
<i>so smoothly or so quickly.</i>

01:05.648 --> 01:10.070
<i>Student loans can set you up</i>
<i>on a path of disappointment and dead ends.</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:11.821
<i>It's supposed to be a good decision.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:13.907
<i>They think they're</i>
<i>signing up for opportunity,</i>

01:13.990 --> 01:15.992
<i>but in many ways</i>
<i>they're signing up for debt.</i>

01:16.576 --> 01:19.746
<i>One day, I logged in</i>
<i>to check my student loan balance.</i>

01:19.829 --> 01:24.167
<i>I clicked record and</i>
<i>kind of captured the reaction I had.</i>

01:24.250 --> 01:26.127
<i>I started with 80,000.</i>

01:26.211 --> 01:28.838
<i>I have been paying for 10 years.</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:34.260
<i>The grand total is I have paid $120,000,</i>

01:34.344 --> 01:37.472
<i>and I still owe 76.</i>

01:37.555 --> 01:41.935
<i>How the **** is this possible?</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:48.024
<i>There's now more than</i>
<i>$1.7 trillion of student loan debt,</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:53.822
<i>with nearly 45 million Americans</i>
<i>getting a student loan bill each month.</i>

01:54.489 --> 01:58.868
<i>[narrator] </i>Total student debt
has tripled in less than 15 years.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.412
<i>Americans now owe more in student loans</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:04.624
<i>than in auto loans or in credit card debt.</i>

02:04.707 --> 02:08.086
<i>It's a crisis that we have to address.</i>

02:08.169 --> 02:11.464
<i>[narrator] </i>Why are so many people
drowning in student loan debt

02:11.548 --> 02:14.050
<i>for years after they graduate?</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:16.261
<i>And what can we do about it?</i>

02:18.596 --> 02:22.142
<i>[narrator 2]</i>
Good education is good business.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.895
<i>We cannot meet</i>
<i>the complexities of modern life</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.481
<i>with outmoded school systems.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:31.568

<i>on education right now?</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:33.611
<i>[man] People paying the price</i>
<i>are young Americans,</i>

02:33.695 --> 02:36.239
<i>some straddling</i>
<i>thousands of dollars in student loans</i>

02:36.322 --> 02:38.741
<i>they borrowed</i>
<i>for a degree that doesn't lead to a job.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:42.579
<i>If you don't go to college,</i>
<i>you might as well get a face tattoo.</i>

02:43.163 --> 02:45.498
<i>I might be late to the game</i>
<i>learning about this.</i>

02:45.582 --> 02:47.667
<i>Student loans are really messed up.</i>

02:55.884 --> 03:00.805
<i>[narrator] </i>It all started back in 1957,
when Earth got an extra moon.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.057
<i>That's what headlines called it,</i>

03:04.225 --> 03:07.020
<i>though its Russian name was Sputnik.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:10.064
<i>It was about the size of a beach ball,</i>

03:10.148 --> 03:13.818
<i>and it was hurled into space</i>
<i>by a Soviet rocket.</i>

03:13.902 --> 03:15.486
<i>[Soviet nationalist music plays]</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:19.574
<i>Anyone with a halfway decent radio</i>
<i>could listen to its faint bleating</i>

03:19.657 --> 03:21.326
<i>as it raced around the globe.</i>

03:21.409 --> 03:23.578
<i>[beeping]</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:26.706
<i>The space race had begun.</i>

03:28.124 --> 03:31.711
<i>Two months later, the US tried</i>
<i>to launch their own satellite…</i>

03:37.592 --> 03:38.968
<i>…with less success.</i>

03:40.553 --> 03:43.932
<i>The Soviets were not above</i>
<i>trolling their rival superpower.</i>

03:44.515 --> 03:47.936
<i>They jokingly asked</i>
<i>if the US was interested in receiving aid</i>

03:48.019 --> 03:50.438
<i>earmarked for backward nations.</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:56.819
<i>President Dwight Eisenhower</i>
<i>addressed his nervous constituents.</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:58.905
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

03:58.988 --> 04:02.700
<i>my subject tonight</i>
<i>is science and national security.</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:06.913
<i>One of our glaring deficiencies</i>
<i>is the failure of this country</i>

04:06.996 --> 04:10.333
<i>to give high priority</i>
<i>to scientific education</i>

04:10.416 --> 04:13.211
<i>and to the place of science</i>
<i>in our national life.</i>

04:13.294 --> 04:14.462
<i>[narrator] </i>At the time,

04:14.545 --> 04:17.590
<i>less than eight percent</i>
<i>of Americans had a bachelor's degree,</i>

04:17.674 --> 04:20.218
<i>and most of those graduates</i>
<i>were white and male.</i>

04:20.843 --> 04:23.429
<i>Some went to expensive private schools.</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:28.268
<i>Others attended public universities,</i>
<i>where state funding kept tuition low.</i>

04:28.351 --> 04:30.853
<i>But some people still couldn't afford it.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:34.649
<i>Student loans weren't really an option,</i>
<i>because banks weren't interested</i>

04:34.732 --> 04:37.568
<i>in handing out</i>
<i>thousands of dollars to teenagers.</i>

04:38.152 --> 04:40.863
<i>And so, in the fall of 1958,</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:44.575
<i>Eisenhower signed</i>
<i>the National Defense Education Act.</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:46.828
<i>It created the first federal loan program</i>

04:46.911 --> 04:50.164
<i>for students who were good</i>
<i>at science, math, or engineering,</i>

04:50.248 --> 04:54.627
<i>and who promised not to try</i>
<i>and violently overthrow the government.</i>

04:54.711 --> 04:58.965
<i>Everyone hoped that these students</i>
<i>would one day help the US beat the Soviets</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:01.384
<i>in their scientific Cold War.</i>

05:02.010 --> 05:03.386
<i>A few years later,</i>

05:03.469 --> 05:06.139
<i>President Lyndon Johnson</i>
<i>expanded the program</i>

05:06.222 --> 05:09.183
<i>by signing the Higher Education Act.</i>

05:09.267 --> 05:13.062
<i>The act created</i>
<i>a low-interest loan program for everyone,</i>

05:13.146 --> 05:14.647
<i>not just science nerds,</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:19.736
<i>and it provided grants that didn't need</i>
<i>to be paid back for low-income students.</i>

05:19.819 --> 05:22.155
<i>[Lyndon B. Johnson]</i>
<i>This nation can never make</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:27.118
<i>a wiser or a more</i>
<i>profitable investment anywhere.</i>

<i>[crowd cheering]</i>

05:28.953 --> 05:31.205
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:35.335
<i>[narrator]</i> And that investment paid off.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.088
<i>[Ashley Harrington] This idea of America</i>
<i>as the superpower that it is…</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:41.632
<i>[Neil Armstrong]</i>
It's one small step for man…

05:41.716 --> 05:44.844
<i>[Ashley]</i>
<i>…all of that begins with a workforce</i>

05:44.927 --> 05:47.138
<i>and a society that's highly educated.</i>

05:47.221 --> 05:49.974
<i>The federal investment in higher education</i>

05:50.058 --> 05:53.811
<i>has opened more doors</i>
<i>to more people of color,</i>

05:53.895 --> 05:55.938
<i>to low-income people,</i>
<i>to marginalized people.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:59.692
<i>A highly-educated population</i>
<i>absolutely benefits everyone.</i>

06:00.276 --> 06:02.445
<i>[narrator]</i> When more people go to college,

06:02.528 --> 06:06.366
<i>there's less crime, less illness,</i>
<i>and less dependence on welfare,</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:08.910
<i>the kinds of things</i>
<i>that cost the government money.</i>

06:10.453 --> 06:13.164
<i>More Americans</i>
<i>are choosing the college path.</i>

06:13.247 --> 06:15.708
<i>A growing share of those students</i>
<i>are relying on loans,</i>

06:15.792 --> 06:18.753
<i>and the loans themselves</i>
<i>are getting bigger and bigger.</i>

06:18.836 --> 06:22.715
<i>The result? A country</i>
<i>with an enormous pile of student debt.</i>

06:23.716 --> 06:26.886
<i>It's easy to lay the blame</i>
<i>on the cost of college.</i>

06:26.969 --> 06:30.223
<i>It's true that sticker prices</i>
<i>have been going up,</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
<i>but most students pay much less.</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:35.478
<i>Thanks to financial aid,</i>
<i>the real cost of private school</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:38.147
<i>has actually stayed flat</i>
<i>for the past 20 years.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:40.691
<i>But the yearly cost of public schools,</i>

06:40.775 --> 06:45.321
<i>where around three quarters of bachelor's</i>
<i>degrees are earned, has doubled.</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:49.117
<i>A lot of this is the result</i>
<i>of the last recession.</i>

06:49.200 --> 06:51.119
<i>[droning]</i>

06:51.661 --> 06:55.123
<i>[news anchor] </i>States continue
to cut funds for higher education.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.834
<i>So as the budgets for states</i>
<i>get tighter and tighter,</i>

06:57.917 --> 07:00.920
<i>education is</i>
<i>one of the first things to go away.</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:02.964
<i>And so when that happened,</i>

07:03.047 --> 07:05.508
<i>all of those costs</i>
<i>were also shifted onto families.</i>

07:05.591 --> 07:08.845
<i>[narrator]</i> The federal government's
investment in higher education

07:08.928 --> 07:11.097
<i>also hasn't kept pace with need.</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:13.558
<i>Federal Pell Grants</i>
<i>for low-income students</i>

07:13.641 --> 07:16.811
<i>used to cover 79%</i>
<i>of tuition, room and board,</i>

07:17.311 --> 07:20.231
<i>but now they cover just 29%.</i>

07:20.314 --> 07:23.317
<i>More and more people</i>
<i>also are going to graduate school,</i>

07:23.401 --> 07:25.111
<i>which federal grants don't cover.</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:26.612
<i>And so how do you make that up?</i>

07:26.696 --> 07:28.781
<i>A trillion dollars of student loan debt.</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:33.703
<i>[narrator]</i> The government used to give out
roughly equal amounts of grants and loans,

07:33.786 --> 07:35.163
<i>but not anymore.</i>

07:35.246 --> 07:37.957
<i>The federal government</i>
<i>nationalized the student loans,</i>

07:38.040 --> 07:39.917
<i>flooded the market with them,</i>

07:40.001 --> 07:42.086
<i>encouraged young people to take them on.</i>

07:42.712 --> 07:44.922
<i>I had managed to get through</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:47.175
<i>all my undergraduate</i>
<i>without student loans,</i>

07:47.258 --> 07:51.304
<i>and then took out</i>
<i>about 80,000 for law school.</i>

07:51.387 --> 07:53.723
<i>[narrator]</i> If she had a typical
10-year loan agreement,

07:53.806 --> 07:57.768
<i>she'd have to pay all that back,</i>
<i>plus 31,000 in interest,</i>

07:57.852 --> 08:01.564
<i>and her monthly payments</i>
<i>would be over $900.</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:06.027
<i>After I graduated, I was not making</i>
<i>enough money to pay back my loans.</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:07.737
<i>So I put my loans in deferment.</i>

08:08.321 --> 08:10.615
<i>[narrator]</i>
That means she paused her payments,

08:10.698 --> 08:12.825
<i>but the interest kept adding up,</i>

08:12.909 --> 08:14.243
<i>and in many loan agreements,</i>

08:14.327 --> 08:17.371
<i>unpaid interest is added</i>
<i>to the total amount owed.</i>

08:17.872 --> 08:21.042
<i>So now Holly has to pay even more interest</i>

08:21.125 --> 08:24.587
<i>because she's paying interest</i>
<i>on her unpaid interest.</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:30.885
<i>That extra 31,000 can easily balloon</i>
<i>to more than the original loan.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:32.595
<i>So the plan was,</i>

08:32.678 --> 08:36.057
<i>I'll get out and make a lot of money.</i>
<i>Lawyers make a lot of money, right?</i>

08:36.641 --> 08:40.394
<i>[narrator]</i> College graduates
can expect to make 76K a year,

08:40.478 --> 08:42.688
<i>but that's an average</i>
<i>over their whole careers.</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:47.235
<i>It takes 14 years to get there,</i>
<i>and at first, they make much less.</i>

08:47.735 --> 08:52.240
<i>Especially if they graduated</i>
<i>in the wake of a recession.</i>

08:52.823 --> 08:57.620
<i>There are a lot of people who have</i>
<i>found themselves in an economy</i>

08:57.703 --> 09:00.998
<i>where their education</i>
<i>isn't really paying off.</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:05.002
<i>The stress and the pressure</i>
<i>of having all of that</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:07.880
<i>has kept me</i>
<i>from making plans for the future.</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:12.260
<i>I honestly thought I was, kind of,</i>
<i>getting ahead of the game a little bit,</i>

09:12.343 --> 09:15.513
<i>and come to find out,</i>
<i>I'm actually behind everybody now.</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:17.306
<i>You look at this debt and go, "Well,</i>

09:17.390 --> 09:19.183
<i>I don't know if I can have a family."</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:22.019
<i>It has always felt oppressive.</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:27.024
<i>I even, sometimes,</i>
<i>didn't have quite enough to eat.</i>

09:27.108 --> 09:31.070
<i>It certainly is a crisis in</i>
<i>the individual lives of millions of people</i>

09:31.153 --> 09:34.865
<i>whose prospects have been blighted</i>
<i>by the debt they can't get away from.</i>

09:34.949 --> 09:40.121
<i>It is the reason why so many 20-year-olds</i>
<i>are living with their parents.</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:44.166
<i>It is the reason</i>
<i>I never became a homeowner.</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:49.005
<i>It's the reason why so many young people</i>
<i>are deciding not to start a family.</i>

09:49.714 --> 09:52.300
<i>[narrator] </i>Fifty years ago,
if you graduated college,

09:52.383 --> 09:55.511
<i>you could probably afford</i>
<i>to buy a house and raise a couple kids.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:58.723
<i>And while the wages of college grads</i>
<i>have gone up since then,</i>

09:58.806 --> 10:02.018
<i>housing and childcare costs</i>
<i>have risen faster.</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:06.939
<i>Add on student loan payments,</i>
<i>and this life could slip out of reach.</i>

10:08.107 --> 10:11.527
<i>People who don't go to college</i>
<i>might avoid debt,</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:13.487

10:13.571 --> 10:16.490
<i>Fifty years ago, they could also</i>
<i>afford a house and a couple kids.</i>

10:16.574 --> 10:18.659
<i>But today, that's much harder.</i>

10:18.743 --> 10:20.911
<i>Their wages are actually lower now.</i>

10:21.829 --> 10:26.042
<i>The bottom has fallen out</i>
<i>on non-college educated workers.</i>

<i>So you have to go to college</i>
<i>in this economy.</i>

10:29.211 --> 10:32.173
<i>But the only way</i>
<i>you can pay for it is loans.</i>

10:32.256 --> 10:33.758
<i>Is that a choice?</i>

10:33.841 --> 10:35.217
<i>No, it's not a real choice.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:36.677
<i>It's-- It's a false choice.</i>

10:37.511 --> 10:40.264
<i>[narrator]</i>
Colleges are in a pretty sweet position.

10:40.348 --> 10:44.060
<i>They have this essential product,</i>
<i>and they can set whatever price they want,</i>

10:44.143 --> 10:46.896
<i>knowing that people</i>
<i>can take out loans to pay it.</i>

10:46.979 --> 10:51.067
<i>Plus, they don't face many consequences</i>
<i>if their graduates don't do well.</i>

10:51.150 --> 10:53.653
<i>If you were trying to design</i>
<i>a system to cost too much,</i>

10:53.736 --> 10:55.363
<i>it would look pretty much like</i>

<i>the higher ed environment</i>
<i>that we've operated on.</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:00.076
<i>[narrator]</i>
And one particular type of school

11:00.159 --> 11:02.828
<i>has definitely taken advantage</i>
<i>of this environment:</i>

<i>for-profit colleges.</i>

11:05.081 --> 11:08.000
<i>I went to one of them</i>

<i>For example, the US now offers</i>
<i>income-based repayment plans</i>

<i>[Mitch Daniels] If life doesn't work out,</i>

<i>or the job doesn't pay much,</i>
<i>you pay much less.</i>

15:29.053 --> 15:33.307
<i>[narrator]</i> But there are several versions

15:33.390 --> 15:35.392
<i>with different rules,</i>
<i>complicated paperwork,</i>

15:35.476 --> 15:39.939
<i>and sometimes, loan servicers fail</i>
<i>to tell borrowers that they even exist.</i>

15:40.522 --> 15:44.777
<i>They would tell you</i>
<i>if you knew to ask about it,</i>

15:44.860 --> 15:48.697
<i>but they never offered that information.</i>

15:48.781 --> 15:52.576
<i>And that caused me for years</i>
<i>to go without income-based repayment</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.912
<i>because I just didn't know</i>
<i>it was available.</i>

15:54.995 --> 15:58.290
<i>[narrator]</i>
So call your loan servicer and ask.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.669
<i>If it was easier for everyone</i>
